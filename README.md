# cutils
Some utilities I've made for C programs.

## General utilities

### intmath
Some basic math functions for integers such as max and min.

## Template utilities
These are templates for creating .c and .h files. They are some basic abstract data
types such as a linked list and binary search tree that can be used for any data type.
There are some python scripts for creating the source files from the templates that
replace \<\<TYPE\>\> with the data type you would like the list/tree/etc. to hold.

### templates/bst_base
Template for a binary search tree struct and associated functions.

### templates/list_base
Template for a doubly linked list.
